I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my teacher Ms. Rita Aurora who gave me the opportunity and support to do this wonderful project of Computer Science on the topic Mysql-Python Connectivity, without which this project would not have come forth. I came to know about so many things; I am really thankful to them. 

Secondly, I would also like to thank my parents and friends who helped me with their valuble suggestions and guidance which has been helpful in various phases of the project.
